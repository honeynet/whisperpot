# WhisperPot

WhisperPot is an ongoing project aimed at creating a comprehensive VoIP honeypot system. It is designed to log attack attempts and identify 
potential threats and vulnerabilities in VoIP systems. WhisperPot simulates a realistic VoIP environment and is targeted at security 
researchers, VoIP service providers, and network administrators.

## Features

- SIP protocol support
- Multiple interaction modes (low-interaction and high-interaction)
- Customizable profiles for different VoIP systems, devices, usernames, and passwords
- Monitoring and logging capabilities for SIP messages, RTP traffic, and other relevant activities
- Ability to enrich with external data sources
- Integration with Elasticsearch for data storage and search
- Visualization using Kibana and Grafana

## Technical Implementation

WhisperPot leverages open-source technologies like Asterisk, an open-source PBX, and Kamailio, an open-source SIP server. The scripts are 
primarily built using Python and deployed on Linux-based operating systems.
